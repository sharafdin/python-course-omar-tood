# Data Structure
In Python, data structures are objects that are used to store and organize data in memory. Here are some common data structures in Python:

- Lists: Lists are ordered collections of elements that can be modified. Lists are created using square brackets `[]` and can contain elements of any data type.

- Tuples: Tuples are ordered collections of elements that cannot be modified. Tuples are created using parentheses `()` and can contain elements of any data type.

- Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. Sets are created using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` function.

- Dictionaries: Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{}` or the `dict()` function.

In addition to these built-in data structures, Python also provides several modules that offer specialized data structures for specific use cases. For example:

- `collections`: This module provides additional data structures such as `deque`, `Counter`, and `OrderedDict`.

- `heapq`: This module provides functions for working with heap data structures, which are useful for implementing priority queues.

- `array`: This module provides an array data structure, which is similar to a list but is optimized for storing elements of a single data type.
